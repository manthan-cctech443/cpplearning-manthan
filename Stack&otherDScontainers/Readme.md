# Project 4: Stack and Common Data Structure Containers

## Problem Definition
This project explores the implementation of a custom stack and the usage of common data structure containers in C++. The goal is to understand the properties, advantages, and limitations of different data structures.

## Solution
We implemented a custom stack class `MyStack` that supports basic stack operations and demonstrated the usage of standard library containers like vectors, lists, and queues.

## Learnings
- **Stack Implementation:** Understanding how to implement and manage a stack, including handling overflow and underflow conditions.
- **Container Comparisons:** Exploring the differences in behavior and performance between vectors, lists, and queues.
- **Best Practices:** Gaining insights into when to use each data structure based on their properties and performance characteristics.
