# Project 3: Sorting and Searching

## Problem Definition
This project explores various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort) and searching algorithms (linear search, binary search). It tests their performance characteristics, edge cases, and constraints.

## Solution
We implemented two classes: `SortManager` to handle sorting algorithms and `SearchManager` to manage searching algorithms. The program demonstrates and compares the performance of different algorithms on various datasets.

## Learnings
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Different algorithms have varying time complexities and performance characteristics based on the nature of the input data (sorted, unsorted, reverse-sorted).
- **Searching Algorithms:** Linear search is straightforward but less efficient on larger datasets, while binary search requires sorted input and performs better in many cases.
- **Constraints:** Edge cases, such as empty arrays, and the impact of sorting on stability and memory usage were analyzed.
